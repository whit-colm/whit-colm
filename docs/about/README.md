## Programming

I started programming in 2012 at a Java+Scratch summer class for my parents to get me out of the house for a change. While what I wrote there was absolutely abhorrent, I loved the theory and wanted to pursue it further.

In 2013, I began attending [SkilStak Coding Arts](https://www.skilstak.io) where I learned the essentials of Python 3, Golang, and nebulous Linux things (e.g. bash, vim, ssh, git, and so on). While I still attend SkilStak, it is more of an informal mentoring and advice meetup for help with my own, self-initiated projects.

Through a series of lucky events, I came into possession of a server in late 2017. This more seriously sparked my interest in systems administration and design. Originally it hosted a mish-mash of disorganized services. In early 2019 it was redone to host a single docker swarm to provide those services and more in a unified and scalable way. This evolved into dotfile server stack and now provides all personal services I need including cloud storage, game servers, and nginx websites, and email.

## Academia

I currently attend [Performance Learning Center](http://schools.cms.k12.nc.us/plcHS/Pages/Default.aspx) with dual enrollment at [Central Piedmont Community College](http://www.cpcc.edu) and am expected to graduate in 2021 with my high school diploma and an assosiate in science. Currently with a GPA of 3.395/4
