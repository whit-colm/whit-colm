# About Me

## Programming

I started programming in 2012 at a Java+Scratch summer class for my parents to get me out of the house for a change. While what I wrote there was absolutely abhorrent, I loved the theory and wanted to pursue it further.

In 2013, I began attending [SkilStak Coding Arts](https://www.skilstak.io) where I learned the essentials of Python 3, Golang, and nebulous Linux things (i.e. bash, vim, ssh, git, and so on). While I still attend SkilStak, it is more of an informal mentoring and advice meetup for help with my own, self-initiated projects.

Through a series of lucky events, I have come into possession of a server. 

## Academia

I currently attend [Performance Learning Center](http://schools.cms.k12.nc.us/plcHS/Pages/Default.aspx) for dual enrollment through [Central Piedmont Community College](http://www.cpcc.edu).
