# Private Information Access

This pages serves as the hub to private or protected information. All links either require a password or are encrypted `.tar.gz` files (they use aes-256-cbc+salt). For access, you must have the provided password. If you do not have the password or your password doesn't work, please get in touch.

To decrypt downloaded files via the `$openssl` command (which should be pre-installed on most Unix-like systems), use the following command:

```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in file.tar.gz.enc -out file.tar.gz
# Replace file.tar.gz.enc and file.tar.gz with whatever was downloaded
```
