Currently there is only one node in this swarm but it is designed to be able to be scaled to however many machines one would like to provide. While the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files setup and provide many of these systems automatically but one would still have to setup the server and configure physical network. The next steps for this is to provide these same services in a way that doesn't require a user to interact with the command line at all.</p>\n</MarkdownCard>\n<MarkdownCard>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-linux-weirdo\">Becoming a Linux Weirdo</h2>\n<p>I'm not sure I actually learned anything except how to commit acts of huberis, but I want to go on this rant so</p>\n<p>Towards the end of 2018, I decided to migrate all my machines from macOS (which I had been using since I'd started using computers) to proper Linux. (Side note: I say Linux instead of GNU/Linux because I refer to the cumulative sum of all systems that run on the Linux Kernel, RMS don't interact.) This conversion for me was massive, as I had previously entirely relied on macOS. This taught me more closely lower level linux architecture and gave me a serious appreciation to the miracle that this works (which isn't to say it doesn't, however my customizing is a destructive act of huberis)</p>\n</MarkdownCard>\n<MarkdownCard>\n<h2 id=\"aurum\"><a href=\"https://git.dotfile.sh/aurum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aurum<OutboundLink/></a></h2>\n<p>Aurum is a chatbot for Discord in Golang with expandable commands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-it-taught-me-2\">What it Taught Me</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Using an API to communicate with an an external application.</li>\n<li>Creating a system daemon (although this feature was later written out for ease of use)</li>\n<li>Multi-threading go and using goroutines</li>\n<li>Using bash and perl to bodge turning on/off the bots\n<ul>\n<li>Parsing data through regular expressions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Taking advantage of binary plugins in go</li>\n<li>Data persistence in go through Json</li>\n<li>Partitioning code into easily reusable libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n</MarkdownCard>\n<MarkdownCard>\n<h2 id=\"whits-io\"><a href=\"https://git.dotfile.sh/colm/whitsio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whits.io<OutboundLink/></a></h2>\n<p>WhitsIO is this website.
