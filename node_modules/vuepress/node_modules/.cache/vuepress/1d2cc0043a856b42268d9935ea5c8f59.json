While what I wrote there was absolutely abhorrent, I loved the theory and wanted to pursue it further.</p>\n<p>In 2013, I began attending <a href=\"https://www.skilstak.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SkilStak Coding Arts<OutboundLink/></a> where I learned the essentials of Python 3, Golang, and nebulous Linux things (e.g. bash, vim, ssh, git, and so on). While I still attend SkilStak, it is more of an informal mentoring and advice meetup for help with my own, self-initiated projects.</p>\n<p>Through a series of lucky events, I came into possession of a server in late 2017. This more seriously sparked my interest in systems administration and design. Originally it hosted a mish-mash of disorganized services. In early 2019 it was redone to host a single docker swarm to provide those services and more in a unified and scalable way. This evolved into dotfile server stack and now provides all personal services I need including cloud storage, game servers, and nginx websites, and email.</p>\n<h2 id=\"academia\">Academia</h2>\n<p>I currently attend <a href=\"http://schools.cms.k12.nc.us/plcHS/Pages/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Performance Learning Center<OutboundLink/></a> with dual enrollment at <a href=\"http://www.cpcc.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Central Piedmont Community College<OutboundLink/></a> and am expected to graduate in 2021 with my high school diploma and an assosiate in science.
