Hello! ¡Hola! 你好！ Kia ora!
{{< /lead >}}

I'm Whit, a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (concentration in Software, Systems, and Networks) graduating May 2025. I have been programming computers since the age of 13, learning under [Mr. Rob Muhlestein](https://github.com/rwxrob). This education and subsequent work instilled within me a love for the nitty-gritty of computers; starting out with DigitalOcean Droplets running Minecraft, I now apply that drive in honing my DevOps and SRE skills. Personally, this is through my [self-hosted homelab Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/dotfilesh/ops); academically, this is through my coursework and concentration; and professionally, through my multiple certifications.

I am looking for opportunities to work following my graduation both in the United States (where I am able to work without restriction) and New Zealand (where I am Visa Ready for any accredited employer).

Feel free to reach out, I am always happy to talk.
