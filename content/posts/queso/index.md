# Dependencies

## Tools

- [ ] Cooktop
- [ ] Sauce pot
- [ ] Cheese grater
- [ ] Whisk

## Ingredients

- [ ] **700mL** evaporated milk
- [ ] **450g** jack cheese
- [ ] **115g**ish (like a can) diced green chilies
- [ ] **115g**ish (like a can) pickled jalapeños
- [ ] **12g** corn starch
- [ ] **6.0g** salt
- [ ] **3.0g** garlic powder
- [ ] **2.5g** onion powder
- [ ] **2.0g** pepper
- [ ] **2.0g** tajin seasoning

## Prep

- [ ] Shred jack cheese. It does not need to be too fine or too consistent, it just melts better that way.
- [ ] Drain the jalapeños.

# Cooking

Whisk together the milk, cornstarch, seasonings, and peppers in a sauce pot over medium heat until simmering. Don't boil because it'll make the sauce chunky.

Reduce the heat and add the cheese in batches while mixing until smooth.

Taste and add additional seasonings as needed.
