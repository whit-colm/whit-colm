Recently, the job search has gone from "difficult" to "problematic" to "downright catastrophic". This is partially due to the raw number of applicants limited hiring pool, but also due unfortunately to the integration of AI into the review of applications. In a better world this might not be such a bad thing: in a perfect world this could be mostly streamlined.

{{< details summary="Idea for actually meaningfully automated job search" >}}

1. Rather than a brief resume, each candidate has a plaintext CV of as much information about them as they care to professionally disclose
2. Split job listings into "human summaries" and "position contexts"
3. Have a reasoning model compare candidate CVs with the contexts, the closest matches should be interviewed.
4. Additional human-only questions (for both parties, both the candidate to write and the hiring manager to read)

This solves the issue of uploading your resume just to have to fill it all out again. Sure, a candidate could lie on their "CV" to get the position but there would be a lot more data they would have to forge and people already lie on their resumes. This just evens the playing field and would likely produce more qualified candidates for more relevant positions than the current human-y-ish method, even in my belief 90% of AI is crap.

Unfortunately we don't live in such a world even half as kind, and instead all it's done is make the search harder and more obtuse. Given the sheer volume of job listings, I had the idea to automate at the very least the tedious bits such as such as pre-filtering and highlighting key details for cover letters.
