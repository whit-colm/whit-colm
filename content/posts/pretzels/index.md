## Ingredients

> Measure by weight for optimal results

- [ ] **500g** unbleached all-purpose flour (divided 400g + 100g)
- [ ] **375mL** warm water (~40° ± 2°)
- [ ] **15g** unsalted butter - melted but cool
- [ ] **15g** sugar[^1]
- [ ] **7g** instant[^2] yeast (standard packet)
- [ ] **6g** salt

Additional items:

- [ ] All-purpose flour for your work surface + fixing the dough if need be)
- [ ] Arbitrary amount of fancy-ass salt or cinnamon sugar or something for topping.

[^1]: Original recipe suggested either brown or granulated sugar. I use very fine white sugar. I don't think it matters because your pet yeast is hungry for whatever you wanna give her.
[^2]: Original recipe said as much and that's all I had the first time I tried it (I generally use not-instant). I still had to activate it though so...?

## Alkaline Solution

- 55g/L ratio of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to water.

# Make dough

1. **Activate yeast** by *gently* mixing water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for ~5 minutes (until it gets foamy).
2. **Start mixing** in the salt, butter, and 400g flour.
  - **If using a stand mixer** 
    - Set bread hook to low and run for 1 minute.
    - If needed, scrape down sides of bowl into the dough.
    - Beat on low speeds until the dough comes together (~2 min).
  - **If working by hand**
    - Knead the dough until it starts coming together
    - Add the remaining 100g of flour
    - Continue to knead until dough comes together.
  - If dough is extremely sticky, add around 30g more flour. If dough is not coming together whatsoever, drip in *very tiny* amounts of water until it does.
3. **Knead the dough** to make sure everything is together well.
  - **If using a stand mixer** beat on low-medium speed for ~2 mins.
  - **If working by hand** Knead for an additional ~2-5 mins.
4. **Allow dough to rest** covered by towel for 10-30 mins.
  - Do not attempt to proof it; it just needs to chill.

# Prepare to cook

> **Bonus trick**: as according to a friend, baking the baking soda before the bath produces a much better crust and coloration.

1. Begin preheating oven to 200°.
2. Set out sheet pans with silicone baking mats or greased parchment paper.
3. Prepare alkaline solution in sauce pan and begin to boil.

# Shape pretzels

1. **Transfer dough** onto *lightly floured*[^3] work surface. Cut into smaller pieces for ease of work.
2. **Begin rolling** dough into a rope form. Cut again if needed as you quickly realize how much of a devious little trickster volume is.
  - Start by rolling each section from the middle outwards with the palm of your hand until it forms a snake.
3. **Actually cut** rope into ~3.5-5cm chunks about 2cm in diameter. Place to the side.
4. **If the dough is getting difficult** then your pet dough is tired. Give her a break.
  - Stop what you're doing
  - Lightly cover dough with towel
  - Come back in 10 minutes and see if she's feeling more relaxed.

[^3]: This is something you want too little of vs too much. Otherwise it makes rolling the dough needlessly difficult.

# Cook

1. **Bring** alkaline solution to boil.
2. **Place bites in solution** for around 10-15[^4] seconds. Quickly season them while they are still wet.
  - Make sure the pieces are separated as they might fuse together.
  - At this point, you can cover and refrigerate for up to a day if you do not intend to bake them now.
3. **Bake** in oven until golden brown (~15 mins)

[^4]: Too long and they will take on a metallic taste, too short and they won't develop the characteristic crust.

# Preserving and Reheating

- **Raw dough** can be refrigerated for up to a day or frozen in an airtight container for 2-3 months. Thaw dough in refrigerator overnight. Let sit at room temperature for an hour before cutting and boiling.
- **Boiled dough** can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before baking.
- **Baked bites** can be frozen for up to 2-3 months. To reheat, place in oven at 175° for ~10 minutes. You can microwave them but like... don't.
