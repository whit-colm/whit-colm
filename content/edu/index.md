If you are a potential employer looking for details on my academic career, this
page is probably not what you are looking for. Please reach out to me via email
and I will happy get you a copy of my transcript or other necessary info.

Starting with the SU24 semester, all information for group projects is stored
on University Google Cloud, GitHub, or a class-specific tool. After the end of
the semester, data is archived on my personal cloud. If you need to access a
previous semester's work, please reach out **with your university email** to me
at `whuntle5@charlotte.edu`. Thank you.
