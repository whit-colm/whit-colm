Good god this website changes a lot.

Starting as a hacked-together hand written set of HTML documents in 2017, it seems to've annualy gone through a major facelift. First to Vuepress site (for which [archives for don't really work](https://web.archive.org/web/20191103195023/https://whits.io/)). Now I'm happy to be able to announce v3.0, entirely in [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), now with a cool blog-thing which I hope I can use now.
