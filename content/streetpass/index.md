I'm delighted to know another person is still using their 3DS in this day and age!

If you are reading this, you very likely tagged me on StreetPass, and 20 characters is not enough to express how cool I find that.

There's not much more I have to add here. I hope you're doing well, random stranger I bumped into, whenever and wherever that was. Sorry I don't have much completion in any of the minigames.

If you're still using a 3DS today, then this probably isn't news to you, but you should go to [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) and hack your 3DS if you haven't already.
